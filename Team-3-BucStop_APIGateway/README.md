### Overview:
This is the API Gateway that requests and queries from the main website, routed through a single entry-point to the [[Redacted] Project Tetris, Snake, and Pong].

### Project Structure:
* This API Gateway acts as a middle-man to facilitate interaction between the BucStop main site and the Microservice(s).
* This architecture was set up with scalability in mind, and to allow the site to function at full capacity regardless of the number of microservices it employs.

### Help
