Team Cooked Pull request policies:

* Pull request creator will pull from Dev into their branch before creating new request, this will resolve some conflicts
* Pull request creator will handle any remaining merge conflict resolutions
* Requires 2 approvers, ideally these will be done quickly
* After full approvals, anyone can merge but if there is merge conflicts remaining then the pull request creator will handle these and merging 
* Before creating a new pull request, check if any existing pull requests are touching the same files and need to be merged first
* Can use discord pings for any needed communication
