Snake Docs
1. Snake works when the user interacts with it, however, it has a few glitches including speeding up by hitting the space bar, won’t crash into the wall, and the screen moves whenever you hit any arrow key. 
2. Hammer.min.js is an interactive API that allows touchscreen users to interact with it.
3. Then program.cs will also publish a JSON endpoint for services 
4. Also, I found a copy of Snake within BucStop. So, they use the copy as a deprecated page loaded in the Snake game before loading games using the js files.
5. Snake still seems to work even when every trace of code has been deleted. After deleting as much as I could, I still couldn't figure out how exactly the game was working.
